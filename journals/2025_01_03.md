## Daily Tasks
	- TODO Make an tutorial for learning programming
		- Basic programming and its concepts CS50 - {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfaMVlDaQ24}}
		- Low-Level-Design using Design Patterns - {{video https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6W8uoQQ2c61X_9e6Net0WdYZidm7zooW&si=rooDCZsbKOknO-ug}}
		- High-Level-Design {{video https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6W8uoQQ2c63W58rpNFDwdrBnq5G3EfT7&si=Y19NL3oygZcJ_eGa}}
		- Data structures and Algorithms
		- Unix programming
- ## Scratchpad
	- Found a resource for [[AI]] [[AI/Prompt Engineering]]
		- https://alex-banks.notion.site/Prompt-Playbook-43570d2fe834440487c3aa7393571542
	- [[Training/Interns]]
		- Found a website called https://roadmap.sh/
			- Website has verified roadmaps for learning skills
		- We can use this website to train up-coming interns into their respective choices.
		- Here we need to limit the roadmaps Interns can choose.
		- First we split the Interns into 2
			- Embedded Dev
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Application Dev
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- For Application Dev we can limit the choice of the roadmaps to these
			- Full-stack
			- Frontend (beginner friendly version)
			- Backend (beginner friendly version)
			- C++
			- .Net
		- For Embedded Dev (since we don't have a roadmap for this we will have to create one)
			- Firmware
			- Embedded C++
		- Website only provides the roadmap or index of topics to learn, then we can encourage the interns to find good resources like books, videos on these topics by themselves.
		- Additionally, these interns will also get a mentor assigned to them who will be responsible for answering any questions or solving blockers that we have.
		- Clear roadmap will solve these things for us
