- ## Summary
- For software to exist in the first place, it needs *developers*.
- For software to run, it needs to run somewhere and someone needs to ensure that it’s working optimally: it needs *operators*.
- For software to produce value, someone needs to use it, and get value from using it: it needs one or more *users*. Even software libraries, which aren’t ever run directly, have users: *other developers*.
- For software to *continue* to produce value over time, someone needs to adapt it to users’ evolving needs and its environment: it needs *maintainers*.
- When software fails to provide the value it’s supposed to, users need someone to whom they can reach out and ask for help: it needs *support*.
