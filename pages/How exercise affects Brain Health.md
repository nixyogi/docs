	- Why it improves brain performance ?
		- Exercise releases compounds like Cortisol, Adrenaline and many more which increases the blood flow to the brain. Hence improving the brain performance.
	- One issue with the HIT (High Intensity Training) is that it needs to be done in moderation. If we over do it then acute brain performance might get affected. But in long term the brain performance increases significantly.
