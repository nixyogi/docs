- FIRST, DO NO HARM Andy once had an acquaintance who was obscenely rich. His house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d’art, and so on. One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to a fireplace caught on fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn’t want to mess up the carpet

- You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called “start-up fatigue.’’ It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say “of course, it would be better if we added…’

- We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their knowledge portfolios. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

- Manage risk Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.

- KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:1. Introduction and start typing whatever comes into their heads next. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself,“Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?” Refine it until it does

- CHOOSE A STYLE Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal “just the facts’’ briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts? Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask. Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says they need a paragraph describing something and you can’t see any way of doing it in less than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of communication, too

Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t listen to them, they won’t listen to you. Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively.

- DOCUMENTATION Finally, there’s the matter of communicating via documentation. Typically, developers don’t give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that management will forget about it at the end of the project. Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code

First, given that you’re not sure what form change will take, you can always fall back on the ultimate “easy to change” path: try to make what you write replaceable.

- Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication As part of your online wine ordering application you’re capturing and validating your user’s age, along with the quantity they’re ordering. According to the site owner, they should both be numbers, and both greater than zero. So you code up the validations: def validate_age(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) def validate_quantity(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) During code review, the resident know-it-all bounces this code, claiming it’s a DRY violation: both function bodies are the same

- REPRESENTATIONAL DUPLICATION Your code interfaces to the outside world: other libraries via APIs, other services via remote calls, data in external sources, and so on. And pretty much each time you do, you introduce some kind of DRY violation: your code has to have knowledge that is also present in the external thing. It needs to know the API, or the schema, or the meaning of error codes, or whatever. The duplication here is that two things (your code and the external entity) have to have knowledge of the representation of their interface. Change it at one end, and the other end breaks. This duplication is inevitable, but can be mitigated. Here are some strategies.

- Duplication Across Internal APIs For internal APIs, look for tools that let you specify the API in some kind of neutral format. These tools will typically generate documentation, mock APIs, functional tests, and API clients, the latter in a number of different languages. Ideally the tool will store all your APIs in a central repository, allowing them to be shared across teams.

- Duplication with Data Sources Many data sources allow you to introspect on their data schema. This can be used to remove much of the duplication between them and your code. Rather than manually creating the code to contain this stored data, you can generate the containers directly from the schema.

- There’s another option, and one we often prefer. Rather than writing code that represents external data in a fixed structure(an instance of a struct or class, for example), just stick it into a key/value data structure (your language might call it a map, hash, dictionary, or even object).

- On its own this is risky: you lose a lot of the security of knowing just what data you’re working with. So we recommend adding a second layer to this solution: a simple table-driven validation suite that verifies that the map you’ve created contains at least the data you need, in the format you need it. Your API documentation tool might be able to generate this.

Suddenly you discover that you’re flying a system where every control input has secondary effects. Lower the left-hand lever and you need to add compensating backward movement to the right-hand stick and push the right pedal. But then each of these changes affects all of the other controls again.

- Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of the others. Sometimes these components are organized into layers, each providing a level of abstraction. This layered approach is a powerful way to design orthogonal systems. Because each layer uses only the abstractions provided by the layers below it, you have great flexibility in changing underlying implementations without affecting code. Layering also reduces the risk of runaway dependencies between modules.

- When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn’t be there. If an object persistence scheme is transparent, then it’s orthogonal. If it requires you to create or access objects in a special way, then it’s not. Keeping such details isolated from your code has the added benefit of making it easier to change vendors in the future.

- Avoid global data Every time your code references global data, it ties itself into the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to read can lead to trouble(for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects’ constructors. In other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around references to them.

- Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle. With DRY, you’re looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system’s components. It may be a clumsy word, but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the DRY principle, you’ll find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to debug, test, and maintain.

Completeness The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item. Robustness Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious display of pyrotechnics. That’s okay.

- HOW ACCURATE IS ACCURATE ENOUGH? To some extent, all answers are estimates. It’s just that some are more accurate than others. So the first question you have to ask yourself when someone asks you for an estimate is the context in which your answer will be taken. Do they need high accuracy, or are they looking for a ballpark figure?

- If you say that something will take about 130 working days, then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say “Oh, about six months,” then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months from now. Both numbers represent the same duration, but “130 days” probably implies a higher degree of accuracy than you feel

- Break the Model into Components Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components. You’ll need to discover the mathematical rules that describe how these components interact. Sometimes a component contributes a single value that is added into the result. Some components may supply multiplying factors, while others may be more complicated (such as those that simulate the arrival of traffic at a node).

- Calculate the Answers Only in the simplest of cases will an estimate have a single answer. You might be happy to say “I can walk five cross-town blocks in 15 minutes.” However, as the systems get more complex, you’ll want to hedge your answers. Run multiple calculations, varying the values of the critical parameters, until you work out which ones really drive the model.

If an overall estimate involved calculating subestimates, keep track of these as well. Often you’ll find your estimates are pretty good—in fact, after a while, you’ll come to expect this.

- Painting the Missile“How long will it take to paint the house?”“Well, if everything goes right, and this paint has the coverage they claim, it might be as few as 10 hours. But that’s unlikely: I’d guess a more realistic figure is closer to 18 hours. And, of course, if the weather turns bad, that could push it out to 30 or more.” That’s how people estimate in the real world.

- When the U.S. Navy needed to plan the Polaris submarine project, they adopted this style of estimating with a methodology they called the Program Evaluation Review Technique, or PERT. Every PERT task has an optimistic, a most likely, and a pessimistic estimate. The tasks are arranged into a dependency network, and then you use some simple statistics to identify likely best and worst times for the overall project.

When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules, …). Reindent code following changes. Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command. Undo and redo changes. Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them. Navigate to a particular line number. Sort selected lines. Search for both strings and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches. Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.

- Beware of myopia when debugging. Resist the urge to fix just the symptoms you see: it is more likely that the actual fault may be several steps removed from what you are observing, and may involve a number of other related things. Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.

- The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible. After all, if you can’t reproduce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed? But we want more than a bug that can be reproduced by following some long series of steps; we want a bug that can be reproduced with a single command. It’s a lot harder to fix a bug if you have to go through 15 steps to get to the point where the bug shows up.

- it’s faster to use a divide and conquer approach. Choose a value in the middle of the array. If it’s the one you’re looking for, stop. Otherwise you can chop the array in two. If the value you find is greater than the target then you know it must be in the first half of the array, otherwise it’s in the second half. Repeat the procedure in the appropriate subarray, and in no time you’ll have a result.

- When you’re facing a massive stacktrace and you’re trying to find out exactly which function mangled the value in error, you do a chop by choosing a stack frame somewhere in the middle and seeing if the error is manifest there. If it is, then you know to focus on the frames before, otherwise the problem is in the frames after. Chop again. Even if you have 64 frames in the stacktrace, this approach will give you an answer after at most six attempts.

Then choose a half-way release between now and the last known working version. Run the test again, and decide how to narrow your search.

- It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a thirdparty product—but this should not be your first thought. It is much more likely that the bug exists in the application code under development. It is generally more profitable to assume that the application code is incorrectly calling into a library than to assume that the library itself is broken. Even if the problem does lie with a third party, you’ll still have to eliminate your code before submitting the bug report.

- DBC and testing are different approaches to the broader topic of program correctness. They both have value and both have uses in different situations. DBC offers several advantages over specific testing approaches: DBC doesn’t require any setup or mocking DBC defines the parameters for success or failure in all cases, whereas testing can only target one specific case at a time TDD and other testing happens only at “test time” within the build cycle. But DBC and assertions are forever: during design, development, deployment, and maintenance TDD does not focus on checking internal invariants within the code under test, it’s more black-box style to check the public interface DBC is more efficient (and DRY-er) than defensive programming, where everyone has to validate data in case no one else does. TDD is a great technique, but as with many techniques, it might invite you to concentrate on the “happy path,” and not the real world full of bad data, bad actors, bad versions, and bad specifications

- The basic pattern for resource allocation can be extended for routines that need more than one resource at a time. There are just two more suggestions: Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you allocate them. That way you won’t orphan resources if one resource contains references to another. When allocating the same set of resources in different places in your code, always allocate them in the same order. This will reduce the possibility of deadlock. (If process A claims resource1 and is about to claim resource2, while process B has claimed resource2 and is trying to get resource1, the two processes will wait forever.) It doesn’t matter what kind of resources we’re using— transactions, network connections, memory, files, threads, windows—the basic pattern applies: whoever allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.

- If you are programming in an object-oriented language, you may find it useful to encapsulate resources in classes. Each time you need a particular resource type, you instantiate an object of that class. When the object goes out of scope, or is reclaimed by the garbage collector, the object’s destructor then deallocates the wrapped resource.

- Languages that support exceptions can make resource deallocation tricky. If an exception is thrown, how do you guarantee that everything allocated prior to the exception is tidied up? The answer depends to some extent on the language support. You generally have two choices:1. Use variable scope (for example, stack variables in C++ or Rust)2. Use a finally clause in a try…catch block With usual scoping rules in languages such as C++ or Rust, the variable’s memory will be reclaimed when the variable goes out of scope via a return, block exit, or exception.

- WHEN YOU CAN’T BALANCE RESOURCES There are times when the basic resource allocation pattern just isn’t appropriate. Commonly this is found in programs that use dynamic data structures.

- The trick here is to establish a semantic invariant for memory allocation. You need to decide who is responsible for data in an aggregate data structure. What happens when you deallocate the top-level structure? You have three main options: The top-level structure is also responsible for freeing any substructures that it contains. These structures then recursively delete data they contain, and so on. The top-level structure is simply deallocated. Any structures that it pointed to (that are not referenced elsewhere) are orphaned. The top-level structure refuses to deallocate itself if it contains any substructures.

- Implementing any of these options in a procedural language such as C can be a problem: data structures themselves are not active. Our preference in these circumstances is to write a module for each major structure that provides standard allocation and deallocation facilities for that structure. (This module can also provide facilities such as debug printing, serialization, deserialization, and traversal hooks.)

- For most applications, this normally means producing wrappers for each type of resource, and using these wrappers to keep track of all allocations and deallocations. At certain points in your code, the program logic will dictate that the resources will be in a certain state: use the wrappers to check this. For example, a long-running program that services requests will probably have a single point at the top of its main processing loop where it waits for the next request to arrive.

- Instead of wasting effort designing for an uncertain future, you can always fall back on designing your code to be replaceable. Make it easy to throw out your code and replace it with something better suited. Making code replaceable will also help with cohesion, coupling, and DRY, leading to a better design overall.

- Streams let us treat events as if they were a collection of data. It’s as if we had a list of events, which got longer when new events arrive. The beauty of that is that we can treat streams just like any other collection: we can manipulate, combine, filter, and do all the other data-ish things we know so well.

- In the transformational model, we turn that on its head. Instead of little pools of data spread all over the system, think of data as a mighty river, a flow. Data becomes a peer to functionality: a pipeline is a sequence of code → data → code → data…. The data is no longer tied to a particular group of functions, as it is in a class definition. Instead it is free to represent the unfolding progress of our application as it transforms its inputs into its outputs. This means that we can greatly reduce coupling: a function can be used (and reused) anywhere its parameters match the output of some other function.

- That’s what we’re dealing with when we look at mixins. The basic idea is simple: we want to be able to extend classes and objects with new functionality without using inheritance. So we create a set of these functions, give that set a name, and then somehow extend a class or object with them. At that point, you’ve created a new class or object that combines the capabilities of the original and all its mixins.

She also sees the pie count is one and makes the same promise to her customer.

- Let’s assume both waiters execute the code at the same time. They both try to lock the semaphore, but only one succeeds. The one that gets the semaphore continues to run as normal. The one that doesn’t get the semaphore is suspended until the semaphore becomes available (the waiter waits…). When the first waiter completes the order they unlock the semaphore and the second waiter continues running. They now see there’s no pie in the case, and apologize to the customer.

- An actor is an independent virtual processor with its own local (and private) state. Each actor has a mailbox. When a message appears in the mailbox and the actor is idle, it kicks into life and processes the message. When it finishes processing, it processes another message in the mailbox, or, if the mailbox is empty, it goes back to sleep. When processing a message, an actor can create other actors, send messages to other actors that it knows about, and create a new state that will become the current state when the next message is processed.

- There are a few things that you won’t find in the definition of actors: There’s no single thing that’s in control. Nothing schedules what happens next, or orchestrates the transfer of information from the raw data to the final output. The only state in the system is held in messages and in the local state of each actor. Messages cannot be examined except by being read by their recipient, and local state is inaccessible outside the actor. All messages are one way—there’s no concept of replying. If you want an actor to return a response, you include your own mailbox address in the message you send it, and it will (eventually) send the response as just another message to that mailbox. An actor processes each message to completion, and only processes one message at a time.

- Do the following.1. Write “I’m prototyping” on a sticky note, and stick it on the side of your screen.2. Remind yourself that prototypes are meant to fail. And remind yourself that prototypes get thrown away, even if they don’t fail. There is no downside to doing this.3. In your empty editor buffer, create a comment describing in one sentence what you want to learn or do.4. Start coding

Sometimes a design just feels wrong, or some requirement makes you feel uneasy. Stop and analyze these feelings. If you’re in a supportive environment, express them out loud. Explore them. The chances are that there’s something lurking in that dark doorway. Listen to your instincts and avoid the problem before it jumps out at you.

- It’s easy to be fooled by this line of thought. Why should you take the risk of messing with something that’s working? Well, we can think of several reasons: It may not really be working—it might just look like it is. The boundary condition you rely on may be just an accident. In different circumstances (a different screen resolution, more CPU cores), it might behave differently. Undocumented behavior may change with the next release of the library. Additional and unnecessary calls make your code slower. Additional calls increase the risk of introducing new bugs of their own

- We want to spend less time churning out code, catch and fix errors as early in the development cycle as possible, and create fewer errors to begin with. It helps if we can program deliberately: Always be aware of what you are doing. Fred let things get slowly out of hand, until he ended up boiled, like the frog here. Can you explain the code, in detail, to a more junior programmer? If not, perhaps you are relying on coincidences. Don’t code in the dark. Build an application you don’t fully grasp, or use a technology you don’t understand, and you’ll likely be bitten by coincidences. If you’re not sure why it works, you won’t know why it fails. Proceed from a plan, whether that plan is in your head, on the back of a cocktail napkin, or on a whiteboard.

- Rely only on reliable things. Don’t depend on assumptions. If you can’t tell if something is reliable, assume the worst. Document your assumptions. Topic 23, Design by Contract, can help clarify your assumptions in your own mind, as well as help communicate them to others. Don’t just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don’t guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions(see Topic 25, Assertive Programming). If your assertion is right, you have improved the documentation in your code. If you discover your assumption is wrong, then count yourself lucky. Prioritize your effort. Spend time on the important aspects; more than likely, these are the hard parts. If you don’t have fundamentals or infrastructure correct, brilliant bells and whistles will be irrelevant. Don’t be a slave to history. Don’t let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate. Even within one program, don’t let what you’ve already done constrain what you do next—be ready to refactor (see Topic 40, Refactoring). This decision may impact the project schedule. The assumption is that the impact will be less than the cost of not making the change.

If that loop contains an inner loop, then you’re looking at . You should be asking yourself how large these values can get. If the numbers are bounded, then you’ll know how long the code will take to run. If the numbers depend on external factors (such as the number of records in an overnight batch run, or the number of names in a list of people), then you might want to stop and consider the effect that large values may have on your running time or memory consumption.

Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything.3. Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, split a method, rename a variable. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging

- The basic cycle of TDD is:1. Decide on a small piece of functionality you want to add.2. Write a test that will pass once that functionality is implemented.3. Run all tests. Verify that the only failure is the one you just wrote.4. Write the smallest amount of code needed to get the test to pass, and verify that the tests now run cleanly.5. Refactor your code: see if there is a way to improve on what you just wrote (the test or the function). Make sure the tests still pass when you’re done

- However, we’ve also seen people become slaves to TDD. This manifests itself in a number of ways: They spend inordinate amounts of time ensuring that they always have 100% test coverage. They have lots of redundant tests. For example, before writing a class for the first time, many TDD adherents will first write a failing test that simply references the class’s name. It fails, then they write an empty class definition and it passes. But now you have a test that does absolutely nothing; the next test you write will also reference the class, and so it makes the first unnecessary. There’s more stuff to change if the class name changes later. And this is just a trivial example. Their designs tend to start at the bottom and work their way up.(See Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down vs. The Way You Should Do It.)

- This means you’ll often need to test a piece of software once it has been deployed—with real-world data flowing though its veins. Unlike a circuit board or chip, we don’t have test pins in software, but we can provide various views into the internal state of a module, without using the debugger (which may be inconvenient or impossible in a production application).

- The test found a bug, but it wasn’t to do with stock level adjustment. Instead, it found a bug in our in_stock function. This is both the power and the frustration of property-based testing. It’s powerful because you set up some rules for generating inputs, set up some assertions for validating output, and then just let it rip.

- Our suggestion is that when a property-based test fails, find out what parameters it was passing to the test function, and then use those values to create a separate, regular, unit test. That unit test does two things for you. First, it lets you focus in on the problem without all the additional calls being made into your code by the property-based testing framework. Second, that unit test acts as a regression test.

- You work for a publisher of paper and electronic books. You’re given a new requirement: Shipping should be free on all orders costing $50 or more. Stop for a second and imagine yourself in that position. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? The chances are very good that you had questions: Does the $50 include tax? Does the $50 include current shipping charges? Does the $50 have to be for paper books, or can the order also include ebooks? What kind of shipping is offered? Priority? Ground? What about international orders? How often will the $50 limit change in the future? That’s what we do. When given something that seems simple, we annoy people by looking for edge cases and asking abou

This is both an intellectual process and a creative one: you’re thinking on your feet and you’re contributing to a solution that is likely to be better than one that either you or the client would have produced alone.

Different people bring different backgrounds and experience, different problemsolving techniques and approaches, and differing levels of focus and attention to any given problem.

Think of our set of test suites as an elaborate security system, designed to sound the alarm when a bug shows up. How better to test a security system than to try to break in? After you have written a test to detect a particular bug, cause the bug deliberately and make sure the test complains.
