- FIRST, DO NO HARM Andy once had an acquaintance who was obscenely rich. His house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d’art, and so on. One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to a fireplace caught on fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn’t want to mess up the carpet

- You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called “start-up fatigue.’’ It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say “of course, it would be better if we added…’

- We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their knowledge portfolios. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

- Manage risk Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.

- KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:1. Introduction and start typing whatever comes into their heads next. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself,“Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?” Refine it until it does

- CHOOSE A STYLE Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal “just the facts’’ briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts? Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask. Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says they need a paragraph describing something and you can’t see any way of doing it in less than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of communication, too

Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t listen to them, they won’t listen to you. Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively.

- DOCUMENTATION Finally, there’s the matter of communicating via documentation. Typically, developers don’t give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that management will forget about it at the end of the project. Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code

First, given that you’re not sure what form change will take, you can always fall back on the ultimate “easy to change” path: try to make what you write replaceable.

- Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication As part of your online wine ordering application you’re capturing and validating your user’s age, along with the quantity they’re ordering. According to the site owner, they should both be numbers, and both greater than zero. So you code up the validations: def validate_age(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) def validate_quantity(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) During code review, the resident know-it-all bounces this code, claiming it’s a DRY violation: both function bodies are the same

- REPRESENTATIONAL DUPLICATION Your code interfaces to the outside world: other libraries via APIs, other services via remote calls, data in external sources, and so on. And pretty much each time you do, you introduce some kind of DRY violation: your code has to have knowledge that is also present in the external thing. It needs to know the API, or the schema, or the meaning of error codes, or whatever. The duplication here is that two things (your code and the external entity) have to have knowledge of the representation of their interface. Change it at one end, and the other end breaks. This duplication is inevitable, but can be mitigated. Here are some strategies.

- Duplication Across Internal APIs For internal APIs, look for tools that let you specify the API in some kind of neutral format. These tools will typically generate documentation, mock APIs, functional tests, and API clients, the latter in a number of different languages. Ideally the tool will store all your APIs in a central repository, allowing them to be shared across teams.

- Duplication with Data Sources Many data sources allow you to introspect on their data schema. This can be used to remove much of the duplication between them and your code. Rather than manually creating the code to contain this stored data, you can generate the containers directly from the schema.

- There’s another option, and one we often prefer. Rather than writing code that represents external data in a fixed structure(an instance of a struct or class, for example), just stick it into a key/value data structure (your language might call it a map, hash, dictionary, or even object).

- On its own this is risky: you lose a lot of the security of knowing just what data you’re working with. So we recommend adding a second layer to this solution: a simple table-driven validation suite that verifies that the map you’ve created contains at least the data you need, in the format you need it. Your API documentation tool might be able to generate this.

Suddenly you discover that you’re flying a system where every control input has secondary effects. Lower the left-hand lever and you need to add compensating backward movement to the right-hand stick and push the right pedal. But then each of these changes affects all of the other controls again.

- Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of the others. Sometimes these components are organized into layers, each providing a level of abstraction. This layered approach is a powerful way to design orthogonal systems. Because each layer uses only the abstractions provided by the layers below it, you have great flexibility in changing underlying implementations without affecting code. Layering also reduces the risk of runaway dependencies between modules.

- When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn’t be there. If an object persistence scheme is transparent, then it’s orthogonal. If it requires you to create or access objects in a special way, then it’s not. Keeping such details isolated from your code has the added benefit of making it easier to change vendors in the future.

- Avoid global data Every time your code references global data, it ties itself into the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to read can lead to trouble(for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects’ constructors. In other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around references to them.

- Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle. With DRY, you’re looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system’s components. It may be a clumsy word, but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the DRY principle, you’ll find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to debug, test, and maintain.

Completeness The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item. Robustness Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious display of pyrotechnics. That’s okay.
