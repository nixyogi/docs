This isn’t a one-time audit of current practices—it’s an ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every project. Never run on auto-pilot.

- FIRST, DO NO HARM Andy once had an acquaintance who was obscenely rich. His house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d’art, and so on. One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to a fireplace caught on fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn’t want to mess up the carpet

- You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called “start-up fatigue.’’ It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say “of course, it would be better if we added…’

- We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their knowledge portfolios. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

- Manage risk Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.

- KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE You’re communicating only if you’re conveying what you mean to convey—just talking isn’t enough. To do that, you need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.

- KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:1. Introduction and start typing whatever comes into their heads next. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself,“Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?” Refine it until it does

- CHOOSE YOUR MOMENT It’s six o’clock on Friday afternoon, following a week when the auditors have been in. Your boss’s youngest is in the hospital, it’s pouring rain outside, and the commute home is guaranteed to be a nightmare. This probably isn’t a good time to ask her for a memory upgrade for your laptop.

- CHOOSE A STYLE Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal “just the facts’’ briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts? Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask. Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says they need a paragraph describing something and you can’t see any way of doing it in less than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of communication, too

- MAKE IT LOOK GOOD Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience. Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely on content when producing written documents. We think this is a mistake. Any chef (or watcher of the Food Network) will tell you that you can slave in the kitchen for hours only to ruin your efforts with poor presentation

- INVOLVE YOUR AUDIENCE We often find that the documents we produce end up being less important than the process we go through to produce them. If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You’ll build a good working relationship, and you’ll probably produce a better document in the process.

- BE A LISTENER There’s one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you: listen to them. Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t listen to them, they won’t listen to you. Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively. Who knows, you might even learn something.

- DOCUMENTATION Finally, there’s the matter of communicating via documentation. Typically, developers don’t give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that management will forget about it at the end of the project. Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code

- However, this doesn’t mean we agree with the folks who say that every function, data structure, type declaration, etc., needs its own comment. This kind of mechanical comment writing actually makes it more difficult to maintain code: now there are two things to update when you make a change. So restrict your non-API commenting to discussing why something is done, its purpose and its goal.

- Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits of a project that can’t be documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on.

- A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing. So we believe in the ETC principle: Easier to Change. ETC. That’s it.

- You may need to spend a week or so deliberately asking yourself “did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change?” Do it when you save a file. Do it when you write a test. Do it when you fix a bug.

- There’s an implicit premise in ETC. It assumes that a person can tell which of many paths will be easier to change in the future. Much of the time, common sense will be correct, and you can make an educated guess.

- Sometimes, though, you won’t have a clue. That’s OK. In those cases, we think you can do two things. First, given that you’re not sure what form change will take, you can always fall back on the ultimate “easy to change” path: try to make what you write replaceable. That way, whatever happens in the future, this chunk of code won’t be a roadblock.
