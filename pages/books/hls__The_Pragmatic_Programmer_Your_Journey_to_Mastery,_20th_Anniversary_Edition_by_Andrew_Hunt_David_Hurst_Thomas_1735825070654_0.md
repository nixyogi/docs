- FIRST, DO NO HARM Andy once had an acquaintance who was obscenely rich. His house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d’art, and so on. One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to a fireplace caught on fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn’t want to mess up the carpet

- You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called “start-up fatigue.’’ It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say “of course, it would be better if we added…’

- We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their knowledge portfolios. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

- Manage risk Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.

- KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:1. Introduction and start typing whatever comes into their heads next. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself,“Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?” Refine it until it does

- CHOOSE A STYLE Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal “just the facts’’ briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts? Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask. Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says they need a paragraph describing something and you can’t see any way of doing it in less than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of communication, too

Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t listen to them, they won’t listen to you. Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively.

- DOCUMENTATION Finally, there’s the matter of communicating via documentation. Typically, developers don’t give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that management will forget about it at the end of the project. Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code

First, given that you’re not sure what form change will take, you can always fall back on the ultimate “easy to change” path: try to make what you write replaceable.

- Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication As part of your online wine ordering application you’re capturing and validating your user’s age, along with the quantity they’re ordering. According to the site owner, they should both be numbers, and both greater than zero. So you code up the validations: def validate_age(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) def validate_quantity(value): validate_type(value, :integer) validate_min_integer(value, 0) During code review, the resident know-it-all bounces this code, claiming it’s a DRY violation: both function bodies are the same

- REPRESENTATIONAL DUPLICATION Your code interfaces to the outside world: other libraries via APIs, other services via remote calls, data in external sources, and so on. And pretty much each time you do, you introduce some kind of DRY violation: your code has to have knowledge that is also present in the external thing. It needs to know the API, or the schema, or the meaning of error codes, or whatever. The duplication here is that two things (your code and the external entity) have to have knowledge of the representation of their interface. Change it at one end, and the other end breaks. This duplication is inevitable, but can be mitigated. Here are some strategies.

- Duplication Across Internal APIs For internal APIs, look for tools that let you specify the API in some kind of neutral format. These tools will typically generate documentation, mock APIs, functional tests, and API clients, the latter in a number of different languages. Ideally the tool will store all your APIs in a central repository, allowing them to be shared across teams.

- Duplication with Data Sources Many data sources allow you to introspect on their data schema. This can be used to remove much of the duplication between them and your code. Rather than manually creating the code to contain this stored data, you can generate the containers directly from the schema.

- There’s another option, and one we often prefer. Rather than writing code that represents external data in a fixed structure(an instance of a struct or class, for example), just stick it into a key/value data structure (your language might call it a map, hash, dictionary, or even object).

- On its own this is risky: you lose a lot of the security of knowing just what data you’re working with. So we recommend adding a second layer to this solution: a simple table-driven validation suite that verifies that the map you’ve created contains at least the data you need, in the format you need it. Your API documentation tool might be able to generate this.

Suddenly you discover that you’re flying a system where every control input has secondary effects. Lower the left-hand lever and you need to add compensating backward movement to the right-hand stick and push the right pedal. But then each of these changes affects all of the other controls again.

- Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of the others. Sometimes these components are organized into layers, each providing a level of abstraction. This layered approach is a powerful way to design orthogonal systems. Because each layer uses only the abstractions provided by the layers below it, you have great flexibility in changing underlying implementations without affecting code. Layering also reduces the risk of runaway dependencies between modules.

- When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn’t be there. If an object persistence scheme is transparent, then it’s orthogonal. If it requires you to create or access objects in a special way, then it’s not. Keeping such details isolated from your code has the added benefit of making it easier to change vendors in the future.

- Avoid global data Every time your code references global data, it ties itself into the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to read can lead to trouble(for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects’ constructors. In other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around references to them.

- Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle. With DRY, you’re looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system’s components. It may be a clumsy word, but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the DRY principle, you’ll find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to debug, test, and maintain.

Completeness The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item. Robustness Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious display of pyrotechnics. That’s okay.

- HOW ACCURATE IS ACCURATE ENOUGH? To some extent, all answers are estimates. It’s just that some are more accurate than others. So the first question you have to ask yourself when someone asks you for an estimate is the context in which your answer will be taken. Do they need high accuracy, or are they looking for a ballpark figure?

- If you say that something will take about 130 working days, then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say “Oh, about six months,” then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months from now. Both numbers represent the same duration, but “130 days” probably implies a higher degree of accuracy than you feel

- Break the Model into Components Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components. You’ll need to discover the mathematical rules that describe how these components interact. Sometimes a component contributes a single value that is added into the result. Some components may supply multiplying factors, while others may be more complicated (such as those that simulate the arrival of traffic at a node).

- Calculate the Answers Only in the simplest of cases will an estimate have a single answer. You might be happy to say “I can walk five cross-town blocks in 15 minutes.” However, as the systems get more complex, you’ll want to hedge your answers. Run multiple calculations, varying the values of the critical parameters, until you work out which ones really drive the model.

If an overall estimate involved calculating subestimates, keep track of these as well. Often you’ll find your estimates are pretty good—in fact, after a while, you’ll come to expect this.

- Painting the Missile“How long will it take to paint the house?”“Well, if everything goes right, and this paint has the coverage they claim, it might be as few as 10 hours. But that’s unlikely: I’d guess a more realistic figure is closer to 18 hours. And, of course, if the weather turns bad, that could push it out to 30 or more.” That’s how people estimate in the real world.

- When the U.S. Navy needed to plan the Polaris submarine project, they adopted this style of estimating with a methodology they called the Program Evaluation Review Technique, or PERT. Every PERT task has an optimistic, a most likely, and a pessimistic estimate. The tasks are arranged into a dependency network, and then you use some simple statistics to identify likely best and worst times for the overall project.

When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules, …). Reindent code following changes. Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command. Undo and redo changes. Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them. Navigate to a particular line number. Sort selected lines. Search for both strings and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches. Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.

- Beware of myopia when debugging. Resist the urge to fix just the symptoms you see: it is more likely that the actual fault may be several steps removed from what you are observing, and may involve a number of other related things. Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.

- The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible. After all, if you can’t reproduce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed? But we want more than a bug that can be reproduced by following some long series of steps; we want a bug that can be reproduced with a single command. It’s a lot harder to fix a bug if you have to go through 15 steps to get to the point where the bug shows up.

- it’s faster to use a divide and conquer approach. Choose a value in the middle of the array. If it’s the one you’re looking for, stop. Otherwise you can chop the array in two. If the value you find is greater than the target then you know it must be in the first half of the array, otherwise it’s in the second half. Repeat the procedure in the appropriate subarray, and in no time you’ll have a result.

- When you’re facing a massive stacktrace and you’re trying to find out exactly which function mangled the value in error, you do a chop by choosing a stack frame somewhere in the middle and seeing if the error is manifest there. If it is, then you know to focus on the frames before, otherwise the problem is in the frames after. Chop again. Even if you have 64 frames in the stacktrace, this approach will give you an answer after at most six attempts.

Then choose a half-way release between now and the last known working version. Run the test again, and decide how to narrow your search.

- It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a thirdparty product—but this should not be your first thought. It is much more likely that the bug exists in the application code under development. It is generally more profitable to assume that the application code is incorrectly calling into a library than to assume that the library itself is broken. Even if the problem does lie with a third party, you’ll still have to eliminate your code before submitting the bug report.

- DBC and testing are different approaches to the broader topic of program correctness. They both have value and both have uses in different situations. DBC offers several advantages over specific testing approaches: DBC doesn’t require any setup or mocking DBC defines the parameters for success or failure in all cases, whereas testing can only target one specific case at a time TDD and other testing happens only at “test time” within the build cycle. But DBC and assertions are forever: during design, development, deployment, and maintenance TDD does not focus on checking internal invariants within the code under test, it’s more black-box style to check the public interface DBC is more efficient (and DRY-er) than defensive programming, where everyone has to validate data in case no one else does. TDD is a great technique, but as with many techniques, it might invite you to concentrate on the “happy path,” and not the real world full of bad data, bad actors, bad versions, and bad specifications

- What this idea really refers to is state. In an object-oriented language, the state is associated with instances of classes. But other languages have state, too. In a functional language, you typically pass state to functions and receive updated state as a result.

- In languages that do not support DBC in the code, this might be as far as you can go—and that’s not too bad. DBC is, after all, a design technique. Even without automatic checking, you can put the contract in the code as comments or in the unit tests and still get a very real benefit.

- While documenting these assumptions is a great start, you can get much greater benefit by having the compiler check your contract for you. You can partially emulate this in some languages by using assertions: runtime checks of logical conditions

- To begin with, in objectoriented languages there probably is no support for propagating assertions down an inheritance hierarchy. This means that if you override a base class method that has a contract, the assertions that implement that contract will not be called correctly (unless you duplicate them manually in the new code)

- A logic error a couple of million instructions ago means that the selector for a case statement is no longer the expected 1, 2, or 3. We’ll hit the default case unexpectedly. That’s also one reason why each and every case/switch statement needs to have a default clause: we want to know when the“impossible” has happened.

- Whenever you find yourself thinking “but of course that could never happen,” add code to check it. The easiest way to do this is with assertions. In many language implementations, you’ll find some form of assert that checks a Boolean condition. These checks can be invaluable

- And just because most assert implementations will terminate the process when an assertion fails, there’s no reason why versions you write should. If you need to free resources, catch the assertion’s exception or trap the exit, and run your own error handler. Just make sure the code you execute in those dying milliseconds doesn’t rely on the information that triggered the assertion failure in the first place.
