- You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment. You judge the relative importance of all the factors affecting a project and use your experience to produce appropriate solutions. And you do this continuously as the work progresses. Pragmatic Programmers get the job done, and do it well

- Think! About Your Work In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we’re challenging you to think about what you’re doing while you’re doing it. This isn’t a one-time audit of current practices—it’s an ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every project. Never run on auto-pilot.

- Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire. Unlike the Eton lawns, you’ll start seeing results in a matter of days. Over the years, you’ll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed and how your skills have grown

- What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it’s an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.
